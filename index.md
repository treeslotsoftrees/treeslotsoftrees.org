## Plant Billions of Trees

1. Offer our token for a decentralized community governance of the DAO. This is the first supply of the tokens.
2. Target to plant 100 Million Trees in the first year (2022).
3. Not just plant, but monitor, track, analyze, with satellites and devices on the ground.

## About

A crowdsourced initiative to plant trees, lots of trees everywhere on earth. To be able to do this transparently, worldwide, with accountability, and trust, we are creating a multi-organizational DAO[^DAO] to invest in, expand, monitor, and improve existing and new forests using technology. We want to bridge the gap between the digital and physical world, with inclusivity of the young, old, and new generations.

## FAQ & More

- It all started when a group of Startup Founders was helping customers with monitoring, counting trees over forest using Satellite data. They are geospatial experts, technology product builders, and AgTech experts who are all deeply concerned about climate change. The activities were part of the CSR[^CSR] (Corporate Social Responsibility) activities but they felt it was not enough.
- The idea of helping plant trees, billions of trees came up. Right now, the idea is to create a coalition of companies, Non-Profit Organizations, groups (public and private sector), and stakeholders to be part of the DAO.
- The __founding team invented a Machine Learning Algorithm__ to convert satellite images to Super-Resolution imagery. We will start by contributing our technologies and methods using AI and remote sensing to track and improve existing and newly planted areas.
- Users can also use DeFi to swap other tokens on other networks to offset the carbon footprint emissions due to their crypto activity (like transactions, verifications, or computations) and these tokens can be used to purchase carbon credits from farmers or contribute to the forestation of areas of their choosing.
- A __marketplace__ where locations are crowdsourced, locals get involved to plant trees, nurture them, and benefit from the commercial aspects of it too.
- We will leverage satellite imagery to monitor and analyze the growth, management, and progress of the trees.
- We have already started in __USA, Canada, Nepal, and India__. We are inviting interested individuals worldwide to be part of this revolution, and expand across the whole earth.
- In the USA, billions of seeds[^regrowforest] are needed to regrow forests.

## What's with the bland website?

Yes, we are looking for designers, artists, engineers, lawyers, and everyone else who can contribute and help out. We can have arrangements for pro-bono contributions or you can get compensated with Ethereum based tokens (coming soon), or Ethereum or other cryptos.

[//]: # Footnotes

[^DAO]: A [DAO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization) (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is an organization represented by rules encoded as a computer program that is transparent, controlled by the organization members and not influenced by a central government.

[^ETH]: [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) is the community-run technology powering the cryptocurrency ether (ETH) and thousands of decentralized applications.

[^NFT]: An [NFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token) (non-fungible token) is a unique and non-interchangeable unit of data stored on a digital ledger (blockchain). NFTs can be associated with reproducible digital files such as photos, videos, and audio.

[^CSR]: [Corporate social responsibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_social_responsibility) (CSR) is a form of international private business self-regulation which aims to contribute to societal goals of a philanthropic, activist, or charitable nature by engaging in or supporting volunteering or ethically-oriented practices.

[^token]: The DAO will have a token (network TD) to serve as a mechanism to raise funds and reward entities who are contributing to this effort. We will will issue and sell the tokens and users (individuals or organizations) can purchase the token and allocate (transfer) it towards planting trees, bamboos, or monitoring a specific area.

[^regrowforest]: A recent article by the National Geographic highlights the that [To regrow forests, the U.S. needs billions of seeds—and many more seed hunters](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/to-regrow-forests-us-needs-billions-of-seeds-many-more-seed-hunters).
